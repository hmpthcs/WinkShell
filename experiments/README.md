# Experiments: 
#### *Folder to house experimental and proof-of-concept items*

## Contents:

- **LibinEPDbus** - a frankenprogram to:
   1) attempt to understand how to use rust (sloppy code, expect poor programming practices--recommendations appreciated)
   2) explore possibilities for what could form the core of an EPD-aware wayland compositor API
---

- **AGS-Configs** - playing with Aylurs GTK Shell; some demonstration widgets that might be good candidates for replacing waybar, etc.
---

- **Newm-stuff** - various bits from newm-atha + renewm (canvases), niri (scrolling) and hyprland (touch model) to examine zoomable 2D plane workspace concept and hopefully integrate the touchscreen as a first-class citizen for input and window manipulation
---

- **Stylus-IME** - I dunno. Slow growth here. Mostly thoughts, but my favorite pet concept.
