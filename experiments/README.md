# Experiments: 
#### *Folder to house experimental and proof-of-concept items*

### Contents:

- **LibinEPDbus** - a frankenprogram to:
   1) attempt to understand how to use rust (sloppy code, expect poor programming practices--recommendations appreciated)
   2) explore possibilities for what could form the core of an EPD-aware wayaland compositor API
---

- **AGS-Configs** - playing with Aylurs GTK Shell; some demonstration widgets that might be good candidates for replacing waybar, etc.
